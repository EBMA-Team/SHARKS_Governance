Intraoperative data was captured slightly differently between cohorts in the previous system, so multiple fields have been utilised to illustrate intraoperative capture across cohorts.\nOverall, there are variable response rates for baseline scores across cohorts. This may reflect variable engagement during consultant clinics. The poor compliance for KneeDeformity cases reflects a potential issue for enrolling patients with KneeArthritis more broadly. Historically, emphasis has been made on enrolling total joints into the registry, however in reality KneeDeformity cases are more like other non-arthroplasty cases of KneeArthritis, which may be overlooked in clinic."

However, because the system now separates the questionnaires between the General pack that patients receive prior to their initial clinic appointment and the cohort-specific questionnaire (e.g. IKDC), the short turnaround for TFInstability surgeries is degrading the capture rate for baseline IKDC in this cohort. This is illustrated by the increased missingness in baseline IKDC (Figure 14). It is speculated that Knee Stabilisation cases appearing on the theatre list are being recategorised in the correct cohort too late for PROMs capture.\nIn the new system, patients receiving a surgery booking will need to be reminded that they will receive an additional questionnaire that is more specific to their condition prior to their surgery."
